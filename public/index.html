				<h2>Where I come from</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>I grew up in <strong>Lanzarote</strong> the most beautiful island in the Atlantic Ocean</p>

				<p>Where I spended most of my time surfing 🏄🏽‍♂️ and enjoying the beach 🏝 and play the drums 🥁 in a
					music
					band.</p>

					I was always interested in <strong>learning new things and skills</strong>, one day it lead me to
					start
					learning programming languages.
				</p>


				<p>I started learning python <a href="https://www.python.org"> <img class="iconos" alt="Python logo"
							aria-label="Python website" src="images/gallery/Icons/Python_logo.png"></a><span
						class="tab"></span>
					which I learned it in a udemy course, this created my foundation of computer science, it got me
					interested in Data Science, that's when I learn about <a href="https://lewagon.com"><strong><span
								style="color:#c63232">Le
								Wagon</span></strong></a>, so I decided to enroll in their Data Science and AI
					curriculum, in Paris 🇫🇷. For six months I learned how to develop solutions, creating APIs,
					and training AI models, we had to do a final project with a team, there was a coincidence that our
					team were all musicians (I was percusionist in my chilhood) so we went to create a model that
					determined the note of a guitar being played, it worked with pieces were the guitar was the only
					instrumentt played, with had some difficulties but in the end we managed to create a model that
					predicted reasonably well a piece, respecting the notes, and position of the hands.

					<br></br>

					I knew some really amazing people in there, this was my class:

				</div>

				<p>
					After the bootcamp I wanted to explore more, I had pretty much dominated Python, I wanted to try
					of compiling my code and type safety, so I decided to go with

					<a href="https://golang.org"></a> Golang <a><img class="iconos" alt="Golang logo"
							aria-label="Golang website" src="images/gallery/Icons/Golang_logo.png"
							style="width:auto; height: 15px"></a><span class="tab"></span>,
					It's fammiliar syntax to python it really help starting out, and it's type system was a game
					changer,
					it really helped me change some bad habits like not using variables and not checking types,
					I
					loved the system of interfaces, it lead me to create some more flexible code
					<br></br>

					<!-- tag de javascript -->

					After learning a bit about back-end I decided to learn <i style="font-weight: 600;">the other
						side</i>, so I decided to learn javascript
					<a href="https://www.javascript.com/"> <img class="iconos" alt="Javascript logo"
							aria-label="Javascript website" src="images/gallery/Icons/Javascript_logo.png"></a><span
						class="tab"></span>
					It was really easy to get started, I learned the basics of React, and Svelte, It perimited to
					automate actions
					with the browser console, and set the foot for better web scrapping with css selectors.

					<br></br>
					After some time I was really interested in blockchain and decentralized technology, I was captivated
					with the
					idea of Ethereum the worlds machine so I started to learn the basic of smart contracts with Solidity

					<a href="https://www.soliditylang.org"><img class="iconos" alt="Solidity logo"
							src="images/gallery/Icons/Solidity_logo.png"></a><span class="tab"></span>.

					I was fascinated with the potencial of decentralized technology and cryptography, I learned
					more about the inner workings of Solidity, exploits, and gas optimizations, and I stated to
					participate in web3 auditions in <a style="font-weight: 600;"

				<p style="margin-bottom: 0%;">
					Now I'm creating some project that I had in my backlog, these are some examples of what I have done:
				</p>
				<ul style="margin-top: 10px;">


					<li> An open-sourced <a style="font-weight: 600;"
							href="https://github.com/Ethanol/medium-api-library">medium-api</a>
						written in Go.

					</li>

					<li>
						A command-line Tool for a blog framework for making easier for writters to import their
						aricles
						from
						otherplatforms to their own blog post
					</li>
					<li>
						For more projects checkout my <a href="https://github.com/Ethanol48">Github</a> 👀
					</li>
				</ul>

				</p>

				<br>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
					Talking about other than programming...
					<br><br>
					I'm really interested in IOT and DIY solutions, so I created in my own little cluster of servers
					with some computers that
					I had laying around, and I host in them Home Assistant which I use to control some 'smart devices'
					around my house, and made some pranks to my familly controlling the tv and google home remotly, they
					thought that there was a hacker, we had a good laugth.


					<br><br>

					I also love learning new languages!:
